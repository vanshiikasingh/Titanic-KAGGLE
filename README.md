# Titanic-Kaggle
This is the legendary Titanic ML problem, our task is to use machine learning to create a model that predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.


In this challenge, we need to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).


DATASET

Overview

The data has been split into two groups:
training set (train.csv)
test set (test.csv)

The training set should be used to build our machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Our model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. We can also use feature engineering to create new features.

The test set should be used to see how well our model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is our job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model we trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
